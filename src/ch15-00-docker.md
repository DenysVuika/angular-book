# Using with Docker

In this chapter, we are going to provide Docker support for an Angular application.

We are about to create a Docker image that contains the prebuilt code, test it in the container,
publish and consume from Docker Hub, and even automate builds and publishing with Travis CI.

As a prerequisite, you need to get a community edition of the Docker for your platform:

- [Docker CE for Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
- [Docker CE for Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

## Additional Resources

If you want to get more information on the Docker and how to use it, please refer to the following Udemy course:
[Docker Mastery: The Complete Toolset From a Docker Captain](https://www.udemy.com/docker-mastery/).

If you use Visual Studio Code for development, the "Docker" extension might help you a lot:
[Docker for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker).
The Docker extension makes it easy to build and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code.
