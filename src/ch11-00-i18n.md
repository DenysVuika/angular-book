# Internationalization (i18n)

In this chapter, we are going to build a simple multi-language support for an application.
We are about to create services to translate application strings, switch languages based on user interactions,
and also using third-party libraries for more sophisticated translation scenarios.

For a basic multi-language support we need at least three blocks:

- language files, preferably in the JSON format
- Angular service to load one or multiple language files
- Angular pipe for a convenient mapping of resource keys to translated values

We start with generating a new Angular application called `app-i18n`:

```sh
ng new app-i18n
cd app-i18n
```

Let's also use Angular CLI to generate our translation layer blocks, the `TranslateService` and the `TranslatePipe`:

```sh
ng g service translate
ng g pipe translate
```

We also need at least a single language file to demonstrate the translation process in action,
and optionally use as a default or fallback locale.
Create a new `i18n` folder in the `src/assets` one, and put an `en.json` file there with the following content:

**src/assets/i18n/en.json**:

```json
{
  "TITLE": "My i18n Application (en)"
}
```
