# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection, also known as DI, is one of the major features of the Angular framework.

by providing an infrastructure that helps to move share coded into the separate application services and blocks
that can be centrally maintained, reused or replaced at run time.

In this chapter, we are going to try key features of dependency injection in practice.
