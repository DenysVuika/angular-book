# Introduction

In the first few chapters, we are going to dwell on the basics you may need to understand Angular development better later on.

We are going to start with the main ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features you should come across frequently when using TypeScript.

Next, the most remarkable TypeScript features you should get familiar before starting the Angular development.

After that, we are covering the Angular framework and supplemental toolings, like Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) and Webpack.

Finally, you should expect many practical topics that are addressing specific application requirements and scenarios,
including those coming from the community requests.
