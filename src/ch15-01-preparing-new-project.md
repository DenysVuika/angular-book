## Preparing New Project

Let's start by using an Angular CLI to create a new project scaffold.
We are going to name it "ng-docker".

```sh
ng new ng-docker
cd ng-docker
```

Before we continue, please ensure the project builds and runs successfully on your local machine by running the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

Next, visit the `http://localhost:4200/` to see the default application content that Angular CLI provides you out of the box.
