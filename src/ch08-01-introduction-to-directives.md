## Introduction to Directives

There are three types of directives in Angular you are going to work with:

- **Components** - also known as `Directives with Templates`, see **[Components](ch05-01-components.md)** chapter for a detailed overview;
- **Attribute Directives** - extend elements, change the look and feel of the host elements;
- **Structural Directives** - change elements, manipulate DOM layout, add or remove elements or completely change underlying view;

Let's start with a new project to host various kinds of directives we are going to experiment with:

```sh
ng new directive-example
cd directive-example
ng serve --open
```
