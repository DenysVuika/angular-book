## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/).
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

Navigate to the [main page](https://nodejs.org/en/), download installer for your platform and follow setup instructions.

You can use the following commands to test current versions of the Node and NPM on your machine:

```sh
node -v
# v14.16.0

npm -v
# 6.14.11
```

Please note that the actual versions may differ.
